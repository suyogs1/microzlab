# MicroZ Lab - Hackathon Submission

## 1. Project Overview

### What Problem We Are Solving
Assembly language programming is notoriously difficult to learn due to its low-level nature, cryptic syntax, and lack of interactive learning tools. Students often struggle with:
- Understanding how assembly instructions affect CPU state
- Debugging assembly programs without proper visualization
- Learning through static textbooks instead of hands-on practice
- Bridging the gap between theory and practical implementation

### Why This Problem Matters
Assembly programming is fundamental to computer science education, embedded systems development, reverse engineering, and cybersecurity. However, the steep learning curve prevents many students from mastering these critical skills. Traditional assembly learning relies on command-line tools and static documentation, creating barriers to entry and limiting engagement.

### Our Approach
**We built MicroZ Lab - a comprehensive web-based assembly learning platform that combines interactive lessons, real-time debugging, and gamified challenges to make assembly programming accessible and engaging.**

## 2. From Spec to Vibecode

### How We Started with Specifications
We began by defining the MicroZ instruction set architecture (ISA) with:
- 16 general-purpose registers (R0-R15) plus special registers (SP, BP, IP)
- Comprehensive instruction set covering data movement, arithmetic, logic, control flow, and system calls
- Multiple addressing modes (immediate, register, direct, indirect, indexed)
- Memory layout with separate TEXT and DATA sections
- Assembly directives for data definition and section organization

### How We Translated Them into Vibecode
Our implementation process followed a systematic approach:

1. **Core Engine Development**: Built a complete assembly interpreter in TypeScript with:
   - Lexical analysis and parsing for MicroZ assembly syntax
   - Instruction execution engine with cycle-accurate simulation
   - Memory management with proper segmentation
   - Flag handling for arithmetic and logic operations

2. **Interactive Debugger**: Created a Monaco Editor-based debugging environment with:
   - Real-time register and memory visualization
   - Breakpoint support with line-aware snapping
   - Step-by-step execution with visual feedback
   - Resizable/dockable layout system

3. **Educational Content**: Developed a comprehensive curriculum with:
   - 10 structured lessons covering fundamental concepts
   - 18 graded challenges across beginner to advanced levels
   - Interactive quizzes and progress tracking
   - Sample programs demonstrating best practices

### Key Technical Details and Workflow
- **Architecture**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite for modern web development
- **Editor Integration**: Monaco Editor with custom MicroZ syntax highlighting
- **State Management**: Custom React contexts for debugger and progress state

## 4. Challenges We Overcame

### Major Technical Hurdles

#### 1. **Assembly Language Parsing and Execution**
**Challenge**: Building a complete assembly interpreter that handles complex syntax, multiple addressing modes, and proper instruction semantics.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented a multi-stage parser with lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and semantic analysis
- Created a comprehensive instruction execution engine with proper flag handling
- Built robust error reporting with line/column precision and helpful suggestions

**What We Learned**: The importance of clear separation between parsing, validation, and execution phases for maintainable code.

#### 2. **Real-Time Debugger Integration**
**Challenge**: Synchronizing Monaco Editor with assembly execution state while maintaining performance and user experience.

**Solution**:
- Developed a custom debugger bus system for state synchronization
- Implemented line mapping between editor positions and executable instructions
- Created efficient rendering strategies for register and memory visualization

**What We Learned**: Real-time debugging requires careful state management and efficient update strategies to maintain responsiveness.

#### 3. **Educational Content Grading System**
**Challenge**: Creating an automated grading system that can evaluate assembly programs with complex assertions on registers and memory state.

**Solution**:
- Built a flexible assertion framework supporting register checks, memory validation, and label resolution
- Implemented sandboxed execution with step limits to prevent infinite loops
- Created detailed feedback systems with specific error messages and hints

**What We Learned**: Automated grading requires balancing flexibility with security and providing meaningful feedback for learning.

#### 4. **Progress Reset and Lesson Completion Logic**
**Challenge**: Users wanted progress to reset on each app launch, and lessons were stuck at 80% completion due to flawed progress calculation.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `clearAllProgress()` function to reset localStorage on app initialization
- Fixed lesson progress calculation by removing dependency on unused "goals completion" tracking
- Streamlined completion logic to focus on actual interactive elements (quizzes and examples)

**What We Learned**: User experience requirements can change rapidly in hackathons, requiring flexible architecture and quick iteration.

### Design Hurdles
